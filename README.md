# CIST4B1_AdvJava
A repository to document my Java learning journey.

About Me:
My name is Ashmit, and I am a junior at Lynbrook High School in the Bay Area. I have been interested in coding since middle school, and have 4 years of coding experience, including completing AP CS-A in school last year. I am familiar with Python, Java, and C++. One of my hobbies is reading books regarding thought processes and the way things work; "How Not to Be Wrong" by Jordan Ellenburg and "Freakonomics" by Steven Levitt are personal favorites. I also enjoy watching soccer, football, and cricket in my spare time.

Goals for This Course:
I would like to delve deeper into data structures and algorithms, while improving my Java knowledge. I would like to understand the most frequently used algorithms in daily life, such as sorting, searching, etc. Further, I would like to understand how to eventually scale my algorithms for runtime and memory efficiency.
