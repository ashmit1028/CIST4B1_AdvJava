I have learned that data structures can be used to solve large-scale problems involving lots of information.
I have also learned that it is important to know when to use a particular data structure, depending on the problem's needs.
Further, I have learned how a programmer might need to adhere to either time complexity limits or space complexity limits.
Not strictly related to data structures - but I found the review on the aspects of OOP(inheritance, polymorphism,etc.) helpful.
